Individual Work

## Interaction Guide

There is a play/pause button in the bottom-right corner of the canvas.

- First click: Music starts and all the static shapes “breathe” in sync with the beat, expanding and contracting.

- Second click: Music stops and the shapes hold still. If you do not click again, the music and the breathing animation **loop continuously**.

## Personal Design Details

### Driving Mechanism

I used **audio** to control the animation. When the music plays, the small patterns inside each circle expand on the beat and shrink between beats, like ripples around a speaker cone.

### Inspiration

 I was struck by how a speaker’s membrane moves with deep bass. 
 
 I also drew on **Harman Kardon | Aura Studio 4** , a bluetooth speaker with iconic transparent dome and themed lighting. That mix of sound, motion, and light is at the heart of my design.

 For sound coding, I got inspiration from **Week 12 Tutorial, Part 5 Controlling our shape class with FFT**

### Art Historical Connection

Our group referenced artist **Pacita Abad**, who is celebrated for her **multicultural background** and **vibrant colour**.

**Eye** and **sound** are both vital channels for perceiving the world, I believe.

For my individual piece, I combined the eye motif with music: the eye stands for **observation**, while sound carries **feeling**. This fusion directly reflects Abad’s concept of cross-cultural resonance. 

Also, the eye graphic also conceals a cross—symbolizing multiculturalism and faith.

### Differences from the Group Project

1. Restoring the Spiral
   The spiral circles warped in the group’s responsive movement. I fixed the geometry so they match the intended design.

2. Static Layout + Rhythmic Pulse
   I kept everyone’s static patterns but fine-tuned their sizes and positions for balance. I removed continuous motion so the viewer can clearly see each design detail.

3. “Breathing” Aesthetic
   After testing, I found that having static shapes expand and contract on each beat is the cleanest way to show detail. It also highlights the digital harmony of shapes meeting music. **Less is more.**

## Tools & Learning
I heavily relied on course content and the use website p5.js as reference and learning material. Whenever I needed a new feature, I consulted the p5.js documentation and examples to learn how to implement it.
